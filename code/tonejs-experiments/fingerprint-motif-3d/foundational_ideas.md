The browser fingerprint contains a reflection of the human behind it: their languages, preferred fonts, location, choice of browser. Likewise it reflects the device through the molecules of its graphics card producing slightly different visual noise, the size of the screen, the depth of its pixels.

When a website collects and stores a browser fingerprint, it puts a tiny little trace of the human-computer cyborg on its server. Just the faintest hint of an identity, but oftentimes enough to pinpoint you in a group of hundreds of thousands. Until your human-computer cyborg configuration changes.
