We (the [rethread](https://rethread.art) collective) will now collect your web browser's fingerprint, which is all the data about your browser that any website you navigate to can see without using [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie). A small program, inspired by [amiunique.org](https://amiunique.org), will collect the following characteristics of your browser:
- the user agent, which is the type of browser you use
- http headers, which contain information about your preferred language
- the platform, which indicates the operating system you use
- language, timezone, options (cookies, do not track, adblock)
- a list of all the fonts you have installed
- a list of browser plugins you have installed
- your screen (window) resolution
- your GPU brand and version, for the nerds
- the rendering of an emoji specific to your OS üòÉ üéâ üöÄ üñºÔ∏è

We will also install a 2-hour cookie so we will not bother you again with data collection during your visit of the exhibition.

We use your data to generate this exhibition, live. You can experience your data through different sound and visual representations and compare the fingerprint of your browser with the fingerprint of other visitors.

When you leave the exhibition, we will keep your fingerprint on a safe server, which only one of the artists has access to through a secure connection. Your fingerprint will then become part of a permanent exhibition. If you want, you have the opportunity to delete your data by contacting tdurieux@kth.se.

A detailed, more boring and yet more comprehensive and technical version is provided in the [privacy policy of the exhibition](https://github.com/castor-software/rethread/blob/master/browser-fingerprint/privacy.md)
