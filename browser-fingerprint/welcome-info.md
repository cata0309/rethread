We will now collect the fingerprint of your web browser. A small program, inspired by [amiunique.org](https://amiunique.org), will collect the following characterisitcs of your browser:
- the user agent, where we learn what type of browser you use
- http headers, where we learn about your favorite language
- the platform that indicates the operating system you use
- language, timezone, options (cookies, do not track, adblock)
- the list of fonts that you installed one day on your device and most probably forgot about
- the list of plugins that make you feel like it's your customized web browser
- the screen resolution
- the gpu brand and version, for the nerdy touch
- the rendering of beautiful emojis 😃 🦠 🎉 🚀 🖼️

We will also install a 2 hour cookie so we will not bother you with data collection during your visit of the exhibition.

We use your data to generate this exhbition, live. We let you experience your data through different sound and visuals representations and compare the fingerprint of your browser with the fingerprint of other visitors.

When you leave the exhibition, we are happy to keep your fingerprint in a safe and comfortable server, which only one of the artists can access through a secure connection. Your fingerprint will then become a part of the permanent exhbition. If you want, you have the opportunity to delete your data.

A detailed, more boring and yet more comprehensive version is provided in the [privacy policy of the exhbition](https://github.com/castor-software/rethread/blob/master/browser-fingerprint/privacy.md)
