Here we build software artworks for a fully online exhibition about browser fingerprinting.

[Browser fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Browser_fingerprint) is a digital technology that collects different characteristics about a browser (its brand, version, extensions, etc.) and stores these characteristics in a remote server. This fingerprint is very likely to be unique for the browser of a specific user. It can be used instead of cookies to track users on the web.

For the rethread exhbition about browser fingerprinting, we invite the visitors to let the fingerprint of their browsers. Then, we let them experience the richness of this data. The exbition visitors can also experience how their fingerprint compares to the fingerprint of other visitors who are present in the exhbition at the same time as them, as well as to the fingerprint of all visitors who are present at some point since April 22, 2020.

The exhbition organizers collect the following characterisitcs of each visitor's browser:
- the user agent
- the list of fonts
- the operating system
- a rendering of specific canvas image
