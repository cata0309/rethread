Here we build software artworks for a fully online exhibition about browser fingerprinting.

[Browser fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Browser_fingerprint) is a digital technology that collects different characteristics about a browser (its brand, version, extensions, etc.) and stores these characteristics in a remote server. This fingerprint is very likely to be unique for the browser of a specific user. It can be used instead of cookies to track users on the web.s
